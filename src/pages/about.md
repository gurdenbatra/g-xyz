Hi! I’m Gurden. I’m originally from Delhi, India, and I moved to Atlanta, USA, to study Computer Science at Georgia Tech. After that, I worked in Silicon Valley for some years before moving to Helsinki, Finland, to study for a master’s in New Media Design and Production at Aalto University. Meanwhile, in my studies, I have worked at big companies like Microsoft, early-stage startups like Redfin, a small brand strategy firm in India, and a big design consultancy in Finland.

Now, I combine all my crafts and experience with my work as a design technologist and Civic Tech Lead at Dark Matter Labs, a climate transition non-profit.
