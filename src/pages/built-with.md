description: How was this website built
layout: page

I wanted to use something lightweight and accessibility first and hence chose [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

The page is inspired by the [companion website](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) of Andy Bell's talk 'Be the browserâ€™s mentor, not its micromanager'. And uses [this](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) starter template.

Deployed using GitHub Pages.

This site produces 0.01g of CO2 on every visit which is A+ rated, according to [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/gurden-xyz/).
