Eleventy starter based on the workflow suggested by Andy Bell's buildexcellentwebsit.es.

Based on the [companion website](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) of Andy Bell's talk 'Be the browserâ€™s mentor, not its micromanager'. It takes over a core functionality: Using Tailwind CSS to generate CSS variables based on design tokens.

Like buildexcellentwebsit.es, this starter uses modern CSS, fluid type & space, flexible Layouts and Progressive Enhancement, wrapped in a basic template, ideal for personal websites and other small projects.

The aim is to spread the idea and use of this _excellent_ workflow. To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/), [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) and [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).
