## Journey/story

Data viz to understand current legal system

Can it / should it be a service? 

Prototype and validate!

1. Figma, Kumu, Notion etc.

2. It's all about data and metadata! 

3. Create protocol with team and build CSV via Google Spreadsheet

4. Next.js app to render the CSV as simple list

5. Add more features- search, filter, detail pages 

6. All about Copy and creating understanding of legal instruments (explain what are these legal instruments)

7. Basic branding, feature check, mobile design, analytics and alpha launch! (add github release link)

Post alpha user testing and understanding (what did we learn from Alpha?)

Post Alpha impact: user interviews, tests, traction, grants. Not real usage or engagement yet

And lots of data edits, updates, additions etc. Spreadsheet system cumbersome, need for proper CMS

Gathering and begin work on beta stage launch at week of circular economy.

Onboard new dev team member, create schema, add Sanity CMS, add data viz, improve design from feedback and new content.

Launch event.

Grant, legal team, more council members, more team structure and way of working. 

??? fuck around and waste everything...
